You get the crash penalty way too much. You shouldn't get it from landing flat.
There need to actually be logically placed ramps and jump pads that lead into one another.
The car feels really floaty and weird in the air.
There needs to be a range limit on passengers. Like they should only spawn within 500m of the player or smth.
